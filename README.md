Budgetting-budy app!

Tanuki is a budgeting app where you can track your own finances and also see the financial achievements of other friends. 

The first tab displays all public monetary accomplishments. Each post will contain the name of the person, how much they either earned or spent, their message, and the date.

The second tab displays all personal goals and payments. Each post will be similar to the public feed.

The third tab is a calendar containing all personal payments and objectives. Posts on a certain date will be displayed on the date of the calendar.

The chat is where users will input their payments/earnings and an automated response will inform the user of what has been updated.
